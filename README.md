Perl Scripts for Bioinformatics 

These are some Bioinformatics scripts written in Perl that I started working on for Dr. Guoqing Lu in early June 2005.

We were attempting to find similiar exons between fugu and zebrafish, and I learned a lot from Dr Lu

Initial data downloads were from 
ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/fugu-32.2g/data/flatfiles/genbank/
ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/zebrafish-32.5/data/flatfiles/genbank/
